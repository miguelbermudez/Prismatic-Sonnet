##COMICS, CRITICS, AND SATIRISTS

#APH APHORISTS are not generally regarded as a jocular, lighthearted bunch. But aphorisms are very similar to jokes: both achieve their greatest effect by turning things on their heads. Prejudices and preconceptions, beliefs and expectations, conventions and consensus: these are just some of the things upended by aphorisms and jokes. It is no surprise then that COMICS, CRITICS, AND SATIRISTS specialize in wicked one-liners. "Abstracts, abridgements, summaries and c. have the same use with burning glasses, to collect the diffused rays of wit and learning in authors, and make them point with warmth and quickness upon the reader's imagination," is how Jonathan Swift described collections of such satirical sayings. But as any standup comic will tell you, being funny is a serious business. A smile looks a lot like a wince. For these aphorists, laughter is not just the best medicine; it is the last resort.

#BIO ALLEN, WOODY (United States, 1935- ) Allen was only sixteen when he began writing gags for popular 1950s television programs like Sid Caesar's Caesars Hour, Candid Camera, The Ed Sullivan Show, and The Tonight Show. His films, like his aphorisms, mix slapstick with the sublime, like Ingmar Bergman wearing a Grou-cho Marx mask.

#BIO BALJAK, ALEKSANDAR (Serbia, 1954- ) Baljak first came to prominence in the 1980s, writing about the last days of communism in the then nation of Yugoslavia. Taking his inspiration from great Polish dissident-aphorists like Stanislaw Jerzy Lee, as well as fellow Serbs like Rastko Zakic, Baljak tackles the bloody breakup of Yugoslavia and Serbia's bumpy transition to democracy in his darkly comic musings. He is a prominent member of the Belgrade Aphoristic Circle, an informal group founded in the early 1980s, and author of Monumental Minia­tures: An Anthology of Serbian Aphorisms.

#BIO BALZAC, HONORE DE (France, 1799-1850) Balzac's appetites—for work, for food, for love—were prodigious. He wrote up to sixteen hours a day, often working through the night, keeping himself awake by drinking enormous quantities of a specially blended coffee. He ate a lot, too, once reportedly consuming 100 oysters in a single sitting. Yet he still found time for the incessant rounds of love affairs and socializing that provided him with so much material for his books.

# Balzac conceived of his novels (there are more than ninety of them) as individual instalments in a unified work called The Human Comedy, a satirical sequel to Dante's Divine Comedy. He depicted the struggle for survival in bourgeois French society with both sympathy and cynicism. His cast of characters numbered in the thousands, covering every walk of life from humblepaysans to Parisian politicians."There is nothing left for literature but mockery in a world that has collapsed," he wrote in the preface to one of the books.

#APH Woman is a fortress that lowers its drawbridge not to surrender to the enemy but to capture him. —ROBERTO GERVASO

#BIO BANKSY (United Kingdom, 1974- ) Banksy is the nom de plume of a British graffiti artist who tries to keep his identity secret in order to avoid police prosecution. His work combines street art and stenciling with trompe l'oeil: realistic images of rats, chimpanzees, and people are often accompanied by witty, aphoristic sayings.He's also fond of cultural pranks. He surreptitiously hung his own mock artworks in museums, including the Natural History Museum in London and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. In 2005, he painted politically charged scenes on the thirty-eight-foot-high security barrier separating the occupied territories of the West Bank from Israel. One painting was of a hole in the wall through which a child could be seen playing in the sand with a pail and bucket.

#BIO BEERBOHM, MAX (United Kingdom, 1872-1956) Beerbohm was not averse to turning his sharp satirical wit on himself. His first book, published in 1896, was ironically entitled The Works of Max Beerbohm. He was a keen caricaturist as well, combining visual with verbal parody to devastating effect. In 1898, he succeeded fellow aphorist George Bernard Shaw as the drama critic for the Saturday Review.

### Essential Aphorisms

#APH Anything that is worth doing has been done frequently. Things hitherto undone should be given, I suspect, a wide berth.

#APH Good sense about trivialities is better than nonsense about things that matter.

#APH To give and then not feel that one has given is the very best of all ways of giving.

#APH There is much to be said for failure. It is much more interesting than success.

#APH Only mediocrity can be trusted to be always at its best.

#APH Nobody ever died of laughter. 

#BIO BILLINGS, JOSH (United States, 1818-1885) Billings, whose real name was Henry Wheeler Shaw, called his sayings "affurisms." As part of the plain, straight-talking persona he adopted, he took to publishing some of his folksy observations using his own mangled phonetic spellings. But Billings was anything but a country bumpkin: his father was elected to Congress at the age of twenty-four, up until that time the youngest Congressman ever, and also served in the Massachusetts state senate for some twenty-five years. When the young Billings was expelled from college for climbing a lightning rod to steal the clapper from the chapel bell, he headed west to make his fortune. His father arranged for letters of recommendation—from presidents John Quincy Adams and Martin van Buren and Senator Henry Clay—to help him on his way. Still, Billings ran into trouble. Stranded in Napoleon, Indiana, without any money, he hit on the idea of giving lectures as a way to generate cash. He called himself Mordecai David, supposedly a direct descendant of the biblical David, and delivered an impromptu talk on mesmerism. Starting in 1870, after Billings had gained national fame for what he called his "short sentences, sharp at both ends," he earned a fortune from his books and lecture tours. Josh Billings, not Henry Wheeler Shaw, is the name inscribed on his tombstone.

### Billings's homespun philosophy, and the witty one-liners in which he conveyed it, can be traced straight back to Benjamin Franklin, who invented the genre in America with Poor Richard and his almanacs. Like Franklin, Billings published almanacs, too, throughout the 1870s. Billings's career—and his caustic sensibilities—also resemble those of Mark Twain and Ambrose Bierce. All three men held a series of odd jobs (Billings was variously an auctioneer, coal miner, explorer, farmer, real estate agent, and steamboat captain) before landing in journalism, which provided the first outlet for their aphoristic musings. Billings was also a pioneer of cacography, or deliberately incorrect spellings, a stylistic device that was extremely popular in the late nineteenth century. Essential Aphorisms

#BIO BORNE, LUDWIG (Germany, 1786-1837) Among Ludwig Borne's many claims to fame, these two are perhaps the most unexpected: he was an important influence on Sigmund Freud, and the town of Boerne, Texas (population 6,019), ls named after him. The former accomplishment has to do with Borne's literary self-help essay The Art of Becoming an Original Writer in Three Days, in which he advised: "Take a few sheets of paper and for three days on end write down, without fabrication or hypocrisy, everything that comes into your head. Write down what you think of yourself, of your wife, of the Turkish War, of Goethe . . . and when three days have passed you will be quite out of your senses with astonishment at the new and unheard-of thoughts you have had. This is the art of becoming an original writer in three days." The essay helped Freud develop his ideas about free association. German immigrants to Texas who admired Borne's liberal political views bestowed the latter honor. Born in Frankfurt as Lob Baruch, the son of a successful Jewish banker, Borne changed his name in 1818 when he became a Lutheran. He briefly had a job as a civil servant, but after the fall of Napoleon, Jews were no longer permitted to hold public appointments. So Borne became a journalist, editing a series of newspapers, including Die Wage, which was known for its lively, satirical political columns. The paper was perhaps a little too lively for the local authorities; the police shut it down in 1821. Borne went to live in Paris, where he wrote Briefe aus Paris ("Letters from Paris"), which criticized German despotism and espoused the rights of the individual.

BOYD, ANDREW (United States, 1963- ) Boyd describes himself as a "cultural activist, political organizer, performance artist, street theater producer"and "conceptual prankster." As a student activist in the 1980s, he became bored with handing out pamphlets and organizing rallies. So he began staging happenings that mixed performance art, media stunts, and theater of the absurd.His targets: economic inequality, large corporations, and President George W.Bush. Some of his high-concept high jinks include the Precision Cell Phone Drill Team, a squad of executives on military-style maneuvers, and Billionaires for Bush, an ironic grassroots political group. He also pens what he calls "postmodern maxims" that give a funny, fractured take on self-help books and inspirational literature, providing ample food for thought as we "navigate the jungle of existential terror and paradox that begins anew each day." Like Banksy, Boyd burlesques consumer culture in the spirit of Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer.

#BIO BRILLIANT, ASHLEIGH (United States, 1933- ) Brilliant started out as a painter rather than an aphorist. His paintings, however, never went over as well as the sharp, slightly loony titles he appended to them. So instead of working on canvas, he made quick pen-and-ink drawings to illustrate his aphoristic captions."Soon, I was making lists of titles for pictures I had not yet painted," Brilliant has said. His drawings and aphorisms, known as "Pot-Shots," have been widely published since 1975, appearing on everything from coffee mugs to postcards. Brilliant's rules for "Pot-Shots" composition are strict: no saying can have more than seventeen words (seventeen is also the number of syllables in a haiku) and none can rhyme.

#BIO BUTLER, SAMUEL (United Kingdom, 1612-1680) Most of Samuel Butler's writings were not published until almost eighty years after his death, in 1759. It's a strange fate for works by the author of Hudibras, a long satirical poem about the Puritans composed in a brilliantly compressed and aphoristic style. Published between 1663 and 1678, the book was widely admired, and imitated, during Butler's lifetime. Despite this success, Butler never won much favor at court, perhaps because his tongue was just a little too sharp. He coined some phrases that have gone on to become proverbial in English: "the Devil take the hin'most" and "spare the rod and spoil the child." His reputation was enhanced in death, however; Butler, the son of a farmer from Strensham, Worcestershire, England, has a monument in Westminster Abbey.

### Essential Aphorisms

#APH He is a fool that hath nothing of philosophy in him, but not so much as he that has nothing else but philosophy in him.

#APH Birds are taken with pipes that imitate their own voices, and men with those sayings that are most agreeable to their own opinions. 

#BIO BUTLER, SAMUEL (United Kingdom, 1835-1902) No relation to the author of Hudibras, this Samuel Butler was born in Nottinghamshire, descended from a long line of clerics. His grandfather was Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, his father was a vicar, and young Samuel was meant to be a vicar, too. But Butler came to have increasingly serious doubts about his faith. Plus, what he really wanted to be was a painter, a career his overbearing father wouldn't hear of. So Butler did what any headstrong twentysomething in his situation would have done: he moved to New Zealand to become a sheep farmer. Butler had a knack for sheep farming; his business turned a healthy profit. Since there was not much else to do in New Zealand, he had plenty of time for reading, most importantly Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species. He also began work on his satirical novel Erewhon. When he returned to England in 1864, he was a gentleman of independent means—at least until his money started running out. Butler took up painting again as well as musical composition (his favorite composer was Handel), and he published Erewhon to huge acclaim in 1872. It was his only real literary success, with most of the rest of his books—several on evolution, one critiquing the Christian gospels, some books about his travels in Italy, and a sequel to Erewhon—published at his own expense. After his father died in 1886, Butler was financially independent again, using the money to finance his idiosyncratic literary output. In the last few years of his life, he published translations of the Iliad and the Odyssey, a book arguing that the Odyssey was actually written by a woman; and a reconsideration of Shakespeare's sonnets. He spent an hour every morning revising and indexing the notebooks he had kept since he was a young man. His novel The Way of All Flesh, which had lain untouched in a drawer for almost thirty years, was published the year after his death. But it is the notebooks, edited by his lifelong friend Henry Festing Jones, that contain Butler's greatest aphorisms. "One's thoughts fly so fast that one must shoot them," he wrote, "it is no use trying to put salt on their tails."With Erewhon, Butler continued the tradition of picaresque satire that Jonathan Swift executed so brilliantly in Gullivers Travels. He also shared Swift's gift for farce and acerbic wit. Like Ralph Waldo Emerson, Butler held radical, iconoclastic views for his time, yet managed to maintain a very respectable middle-class lifestyle. And like Arthur Schopenhauer, he was ornery and misanthropic, and pursued his philosophical investigations with a scientific meticulousness.

#BIO BYRNE, DAVID (United States, 1952— ) Byrne, lead singer and songwriter with Talking Heads from 1977 to 1991, studied conceptual art at the Rhode Island School of Design, where he was in the habit of staging unusual "happen­ings." During one event, he had his hair and beard shaved off to musical accompaniment while a woman held up placards with Russian texts written on them. In addition to making music, Byrne also produces visual art and books that parody corporate management jargon and self-help nostrums. Like Barbara Kruger, Byrne often juxtaposes his aphorisms with iconic images—of Americana, consumer culture, medical implements, anonymous public spaces (he seems particularly fond of empty hotel meeting rooms)—that create a sense of giddy incongruity.

#BIO CHAMFORT, SEBASTIEN-ROCH-NICOLAS (France, 1740-1794) Chamfort was a changeling. Born to a mother descended from minor French nobility and a father who was not her husband, he was swapped by his mother for the stillborn child of a local grocer near Clermont-Ferrand in central France. Chamfort was informed of the identity of his biological mother when he was eight years old. The strange tale of his birth branded Chamfort for life. As an adult, he was both proud of his noble heritage and bitter at being deprived of the wealth and privilege he felt was rightly his. Despite his disadvantaged youth, he had established himself in Paris as a promising playwright and celebrated lover by the time he was twenty. In his mid-twenties, though, his luck changed. His plays bombed and he contracted a debilitating illness, possibly venereal, that ruined his looks. By the age of twenty-five, Chamfort was a has-been. During the French Revolution, he was a leading republican yet actively sought favor and patrons at court. Ironically, Chamfort's noble lineage came back to haunt him. He was accused of being an aristocrat and jailed for sedition. He was released after just two days but vowed never to allow himself to be arrested again. A few weeks later, Chamfort was in the middle of dinner with friends when the gendarmes arrived to take him in for questioning. He calmly finished his soup and coffee before withdrawing to his dressing room, where he took out a pistol, intending to kill himself. But he missed, merely smashing the upper part of his nose and bursting his right eye. He then seized a razor and tried to cut his throat and wrists, with similarly inconclusive results. Chamfort inflicted a total of twenty-two separate wounds on himself, none of which was immediately fatal. He lingered on for a few months, an invalid.

#APH "What can you expect?" he said. "That's what it is to be clumsy with one's hands.

#APH Society, which is called the world, is nothing but the contention of a thousand clashing petty interests, an eternal conflict of all the vanities that cross each other, strike against each other, are wounded and humiliated by each other in turn, and expiate on the morrow, in the bitterness of defeat, the triumph of the day before. To live alone, to avoid the bruises of wretched scrapes in which one attracts all eyes one minute only to be trampled on the next, is to be what they call nothing, to have no existence.

#APH Poor humanity!

#APH Society is made up of two great classes: those who have more dinners than appetite, and those who have more appetite than dinners.

#BIO COLEMAN, LES (United Kingdom, 1945— ) Coleman became enraptured by aphorisms in 1968, when he read Georg Christoph Lichtenberg for the first time. The acuteness of Lichtenberg's observations and the density of their expression made it seem to Coleman as if "literary osmosis" had taken place; for an instant, he became Lichtenberg. It was not until twenty years later, however, during a rainy holiday in Scotland, that he started writing aphorisms himself. "The essence or condensation of thought, and how language and image inform each other, has always attracted me," Coleman says.

#BIO CONNOLLY, CYRIL (United Kingdom, 1903-1974) Connolly was the archetypal man of letters: astute, astonishingly well read, and brilliantly argumentative.He wrote eloquently on the art of writing and the compulsion, even the duty, to produce masterpieces. As book critic for a variety of British newspapers, he wielded enormous literary influence. With Stephen Spender and Peter Watson, he founded and edited the journal Horizon from 1939 to 1950. The Unquiet Grave, which he published just after World War II under the pseudonym Palinurus, is a lively, stimulating mix of his own ruminations on writing and extracts by and about his favorite French aphorists. He was a bit of a depressive, though. At one point in his autobiography, Enemies of Promise, he writes: "I have always disliked myself at any given moment; the total of such moments is my life." Connolly gravitated to books that confirmed his gloomy view of the world, most notably Ecclesiastes and La Rochefoucauld's Maxims. In Enemies of Promise, he recalled on first reading La Rochefoucauld that he found "his opinions most reasonable for I was one to whom the existence of good seemed already more mysterious than the problem of evil."

#BIO COTRlC, ALEKSANDAR (Serbia, 1966- ) Cotric began reading and writing aphorisms as a boy, often scribbling sayings on the walls of his classroom. His teachers were so impressed with his initial efforts that they made him stay after school for extra instruction in Marxist education. They couldn't drill the aphorisms out of him, however. He was active in dissident politics during the 1990s, often involved in street protests against Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic. And despite being deputy minister in the Serbian Ministry for the Diaspora, he's still writing dissident aphorisms.

He was never short of material, having been at various times a guard at a Soviet work camp, a journalist in Estonia, and from 1978 an immigrant in Vienna and New York. But his countrymen in pre-glasnost Russia could only read his aphorisms and short stories in samizdat editions that were illicitly distributed in the country.

When his fighting days were finished, Fredro returned to Poland to manage his family's estates. Though he had practically no formal education, he began writing comedies in verse, initially for his own amusement. Today, his aphorisms have become part of proverbial speech in Poland.

He's authored more than forty-four books, including biographies of famous Italians like Casanova, the Borgia clan, and Claretta Petacci, Benito Mussolini's lover.

I'm a bit like a public prosecutor in that I'm incapable of defending anybody but myself and therefore I defend myself by attacking."
